# üìà Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting sales using advertising data. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately estimate sales based on advertising expenditures.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can effectively predict sales based on advertising data from different channels such as TV, newspaper, and radio. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Exploration: Analyze the advertising dataset to gain insights into the distributions, patterns, and relationships between variables. Identify any outliers or significant features within the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and perform any necessary data transformations such as feature scaling or normalization.

3. Model Development: Train a regression model using linear regression with the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method. Use the advertising data as predictors and the sales data as the dependent variable.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using various metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and the F-statistic. Perform residual analysis to assess the model's performance and validity.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- `Sales Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code, explanations, and visualizations for the sales prediction project.
- `advertising.csv`: CSV file containing the advertising dataset used for training and testing the model.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook (`sales_prediction.ipynb`) for more details, including the code implementations, data analysis, and model evaluation.
