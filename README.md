# Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte. The projects showcase my work in analyzing and solving real-world problems using various data science techniques.

## Project 1: Predicting Sales Data Using Advertising Data

In this project, I developed a predictive model to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales. I used linear regression with the OLS method to create a model that predicts sales based on advertising data from different channels such as TV, newspaper, and radio. The project involved data analysis, visualization, feature scaling, and model evaluation.

## Project 2: Email Spam Detection

In this project, I focused on developing an email spam detection system using NLP techniques. The goal was to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). I applied text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, and trained a logistic regression model for classification. The project involved data cleaning, tokenization, model training, and evaluation using various metrics.

## Repository Structure

- `Project 1/`: Contains the code, dataset, and Jupyter Notebook for the sales prediction project.
- `Project 2/`: Contains the code, dataset, and Jupyter Notebook for the email spam detection project.

Feel free to explore the project directories for more details, including the code implementations, data, and the Jupyter Notebooks with explanations and results.

## Requirements

To run the code in these projects, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

Install the required libraries using pip or conda by running the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to Oasis Infobyte for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects. These projects have helped me enhance my data science skills and gain valuable experience in real-world problem-solving.
